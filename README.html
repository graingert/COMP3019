<h1>COMP3019</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<ol>
<li>The program available
<a href="https://github.com/graingert/COMP3019/blob/master/mgrid-wordcount/src/uk/co/graingert/mgrid/lettercount/LetterCountingMGridApplet.java">here</a>
should analyse the textfile and output how many times the character
appears in the textfile.</li>
<li>The applet launched a "Job Results" window with a JTextArea set to
the value of 31</li>
<li>Single Letter MGrid
<ol><li>A parameters file is written containing only the letter 'a'</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/downloads/graingert/COMP3019/lettercount.jar">lettercount.jar</a> and the parameters file is uploaded to the M-Grid system</li>
<li>The LetterCountingMGridApplet.class is then selected</li>
<li>This applet is then downloaded and executed by any
"processing nodes" volunteering their CPU time using a browser at http://example.com/mgrid/JobRequest</li>
<li>The job can be monitored by viewing
http://example.com/mgrid/ViewJobs</li></ol></li>
<li>Multiple Letter M-Grid
<ol><li>A <a href="https://github.com/graingert/COMP3019/blob/master/mgrid-wordcount/parameters.txt">parameters.txt</a>
file is written containing a list of new line delimeted parameters:
The letters a-z "." and " ".</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/downloads/graingert/COMP3019/lettercount.jar">lettercount.jar</a>
and the parameters file is uploaded to the M-Grid system</li>
<li>The LetterCountingMGridApplet.class is then selected</li>
<li>This applet is then downloaded and executed by any
"processing nodes" volunteering their CPU time using a browser at
http://example.com/mgrid/JobRequest Each (job,parameter) is
distributed among the "processing nodes"</li>
<li>The job can be monitored by viewing
http://example.com/mgrid/ViewJobs</li>
<li>This page will show which paramaters have been "UPLOADED",
"ALLOCATED" and "COMPLETED"</li>
<li>Once the (job,parameter) is in the "COMPLETED" state the results
can be obtained through
http://example.com/mgrid/ViewJobs?results=true with the jobNum
and paramNum GET parameters filled in as appropriate</li></ol></li>
<li>Errors
<ol><li>Require submit jobs individually, manually compare for
differences.</li>
<li>Allocate each (job,parameter) pair to multiple "processing nodes"
and compare the differences in ouput</li></ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<ol>
<li>The code for this implimentation is available at
<a href="https://github.com/graingert/gridsam/blob/b6ac5fac7c3ab8bb8df42837172cd775b019b435/GridSAMExample.java">GridSAMExample.java</a>
<ol><li>A JSDL file is created that describes the job to be submitted.
This file is dispatched to the GridSAM server.</li>
<li>Once this JSDL file has been dispatched the JobID can be
obtained. Using this JobID the job can be monitored.</li>
<li>To monitor the job my code prints out any new stages that the job
has been through while waiting for the job to be in a terminal
state.</li></ol></li>
<li><p>Map reduce</p>

<ol><li>The psuedo-code is available at 
<a href="https://github.com/graingert/gridsam/blob/master/mapreduce.pc">mapreduce.pc</a></li>
<li>The implimented code is available at
<a href="https://github.com/graingert/gridsam/blob/master/GridSAMExample.java">GridSAMExample.java</a></li>
<li><p>The output of the code:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./GridSAMExampleRun

<p>This code shows the JobIDs created, and once finished a mapping of
filename to wordcount.</p></li></ol></li>
